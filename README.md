# Silatra

### Steps to build the file:

Actually here cmake, make commands are used

But for simplicity the commands have been wrapped into a single file builder.sh

* The CMakeLists.txt file has the filename which is to be compiled. If you want to execute another file either change this filename in CMakeLists.txt file or change the filename to skinDetection.cpp
* Make sure build folder is there
* From terminal execute command
	`./builder.sh`
	
The **Files found Online are those files that have been downloaded and might have been used
